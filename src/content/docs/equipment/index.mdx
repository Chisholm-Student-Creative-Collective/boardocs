## Equipment Rules
- Only borrow equipment you need, and return it as soon as possible once you have finished using it.
- Let others know when you borrow equipment. 
- Take care of any equipment you use and read the provided user manuals (if any are available). 
## Equipment List

Some kinds of equipment aren't publicly listed here.
