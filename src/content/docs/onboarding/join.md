If you are a current resident of Chisholm College, you are invited to join our collective.
:::caution
Like most communities, we have a [Code of Conduct](/onboarding/coc/) that helps maintain an inclusive and friendly environment. 
This Code of Conduct applies to everyone, whether you are part of the Collective, an associate or just following our work.  

**Please read our Code of Conduct before contacting us to register your interest.**
:::

## Why should I join? 
If you're looking to connect with local Chisholm College residents, particularly those who dabble in the creative arts, then you'll find a home in our collective. Some other reasons to join include: 
- A collaborative and inclusive environment. 
- Built with telling progressive and LGBTQIA+ stories in mind. 
- Networking opportunities to find future teammates and friends. 

### Do I get paid?
:::note[A note about making money.] 
**Our collective does not currently run with the intention to make money**, and any and all work that's exclusively done within the collective will likely go **unpaid**.
:::
You are more than welcome to use this collective as a way to find teammates who can then go on to make a project that intends to make money, though!
