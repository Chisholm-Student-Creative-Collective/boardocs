The CSCC has a program for people who wish to playtest our projects. Anyone who is in the CSCC's Discord server can become a canary! Depending on your circumstances you will be assigned to one of two groups. 

## Yellow Canaries (In-Person Playtesting)
Yellow is our more involved testing program group and is conducted in the Chisholm College's Arts Centre and the La Trobe University Library. Canaries in this group will playtest in the presence of the development team. To join the Yellow Canary team, you must meet the following requirements:
- You are a La Trobe University Student or Alumni who can come onto Bundoora campus.
- You are over 18 years of age.
- You are willing to spare time for a meet up that involves a single playtest session and a short interview that takes place right after.
 
Please note that in normal circumstances Yellow Canaries typically playtest a project once (We don't usually use the same canary twice for a single project). If you've playtested a project and are part of the yellow group, you can ask for a Red Canaries role to continue playing in-development versions of our games. 

## Red Canaries (Online Playtesting)
Red is our public and online testing program. You don't need to be a La Trobe University student, or a Chisholm College resident. We will occasionally release Microsoft Windows (64-bit Intel) builds of games we are working on. The only obligation is that you occasionally fill out an online survey providing feedback.
There is only one requirement to join this group: 
- You are over 18 years of age.

To join either program, please reach out to a CSCC Member (**Not** an Associate) in our Discord.
