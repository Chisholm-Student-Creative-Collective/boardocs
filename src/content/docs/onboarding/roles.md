!["A curious possum."](../../../assets/guide_possum.png)

Now that you've read and agreed to the Code of Conduct, you'll now have to think about what kind of role you can and 
want to have. CSCC has three contribution roles that serve different purposes:
- CSCC Member
- Associate
- Canary

We will cover the Canary role in the next page as Canaries serve a different purpose than Associates and CSCC Members. 

When you join our collective as an associate or member, you will be able to contribute and work on video game projects with other members and associates. Both roles fulfill that purpose. 

Though, associates have some differences:
- Associates do not reside in Chisholm College. 
- Associates cannot fill lead, key or project management roles.
- Associates do not have voting power in the collective.

## Requirements for each Role
